# FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Buffer in Verilog

## Overview

This project implements a simple synchronous FIFO buffer in Verilog, with a corresponding testbench to simulate its functionality. The FIFO allows data to be written and read in a queue-like structure â€” the first data written is the first one read.

The FIFO is **parameterizable** by both data width and depth:
- `FIFO_WIDTH`: Width of each data word (default: 32 bits)
- `FIFO_DEPTH`: Number of storage locations (default: 8)

---

## File Structure

- `fifo.v`: The FIFO module with synchronous read/write logic.
- `fifo_tb.v`: A testbench to simulate the FIFO behavior, including reset, write, and read operations.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

---

## How It Works

### FIFO Module

The FIFO uses an internal memory array (`reg [FIFO_WIDTH-1:0] fifo [FIFO_DEPTH-1:0]`) and maintains two pointers:
- `write_pointer`: Indicates where the next data will be written.
- `read_pointer`: Indicates where the next data will be read from.

**Control Signals:**
- `clk`: Clock signal (10ns period)
- `reset`: Active-low reset
- `cs`: Chip select, enables the FIFO operations
- `write_en`: Enables writing
- `read_en`: Enables reading
- `full`: High when FIFO is full
- `empty`: High when FIFO is empty

### Testbench

The testbench performs the following:
1. **Initial reset** of the FIFO.
2. **Writes** a random set of values into the FIFO until it is full.
3. **Reads** the values back until the FIFO is empty.

## Simulation Results

### Waveform

Below is a sample waveform showing reset, clock, writes, reads, and status flags (`full`, `empty`). You can generate this using ModelSim, Vivado, or any other simulator.

## Usage

### To Simulate

You can run the simulation using your favorite Verilog simulator. Example with **Icarus Verilog**:

```bash
iverilog -g2012 -o fifo_sim fifo.v fifo_tb.v
vvp fifo_sim
